# Cdraw
libdraw made as a TUI program using libmenu

## TODO
- [x] document this README like i did with the [ITC](utils/ITC/README.md) and [CTI](utils/CTI/README.md) READMEs (won't do it lmfao)  
- [x] switch from 3-bit RGB to 4-bit RGBI for more colors (also won't do it, requires modifying libdraw in full)
