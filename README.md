# Cdraw
libdraw made as a TUI program using libmenu-remake (formerly libmenu)

## TODO
- [x] document this README like I did with the [ITC](utils/ITC/README.md) and [CTI](utils/CTI/README.md) READMEs (won't do it lmfao)  
- [x] switch from 3-bit RGB to 4-bit RGBI for more colors (also won't do it, requires modifying libdraw in full)  
- [x] redo code from lines 341 to 346 (kinda done i guess???)  
- [ ] add canvas editing (planning to use gotos) (delayed because C is being a bitch)
0 [ ] add more funny comments in [`main.c`](main.c) because why not
