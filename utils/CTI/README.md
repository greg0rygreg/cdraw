# CTI (Cdraw canvas To Image)
this program was made to transform any Cdraw canvas of any size into a bitmap image of any size (if your storage device can handle it)

## how to use
there are 4 variables in the program's code:

```py
cnv_p = "sample.cdc"
output = "out/sample.bmp"
img_w = 150
```

`cnv_p` defines the canvas path  
`img_w` defines the new image width    
`output` defines the path where the image will be put onto

change those to your liking, run the program, and before you know it, it's done

## how to view
